# SAGE Progress Tracking Feature

## Overview

The SAGE app now includes a comprehensive progress tracking system that monitors user completion of quizzes and reflective tasks across all disability categories. This feature provides users with motivation, achievement recognition, and a clear overview of their learning journey.

## Features

### 1. Overall Progress Tracking

  - Getting Started (0-39%)
  - Beginner (40-59%)
  - Intermediate (60-79%)
  - Advanced (80-99%)
  - Master (100%)

### 2. Detailed Progress Page
- **Recent Activity**: Shows last 5 completed activities
- **Completion Streak**: Tracks consecutive days of activity
- **Detailed Breakdown**: Accordion-style view of all disability categories
- **Direct Navigation**: Quick links to incomplete activities

## Technical Implementation

### ProgressService
The core progress tracking logic is implemented in `src/services/ProgressService.ts`:

```typescript
// Get overall progress across all disability pages
ProgressService.getOverallProgress(): ProgressData

// Check if quiz is completed for a specific page
ProgressService.isQuizCompleted(pageId: string): boolean

// Save quiz completion data
ProgressService.saveQuizCompletion(pageId: string, score: number): void

// Get achievement level based on completion percentage
ProgressService.getAchievementLevel(percentage: number): AchievementLevel
```

### Data Storage
Progress data is stored in localStorage using consistent naming conventions:

- Quiz completion: `sage-quiz-{pageId}`
- Reflection completion: `sage-reflection-{pageId}-current`
- Reflection versions: `sage-reflection-versions-{pageId}`

### Integration Points

#### DisabilityPage.vue
- Automatically saves quiz completion when quiz is finished
- Resets progress when quiz is retaken
- Tracks reflection completion based on text content

#### FolderPage.vue (Home)
- Displays progress summary card
- Shows achievement level and completion stats
- Provides quick access to full progress page

#### ProgressPage.vue
- Comprehensive progress dashboard
- Recent activity tracking
- Detailed breakdown by category
- Achievement celebration

## Usage

### For Users

1. **Complete Quizzes**: Take quizzes in any disability category to track progress

### For Developers

1. **Adding New Disability Categories**: Update the `DISABILITY_PAGES` array in `ProgressService.ts`
2. **Modifying Achievement Levels**: Adjust the percentage thresholds in `getAchievementLevel()`
3. **Customizing Progress Display**: Modify the progress circle styles in the CSS

## Achievement Levels

## Testing

A test page is available at `src/test-progress.html` to demonstrate the progress tracking functionality:

1. Open the test page in a browser
2. Use the test buttons to simulate quiz and reflection completion
3. Watch the progress circle and achievement level update in real-time
4. Reset progress to test from scratch

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for the progress tracking system:

1. **Cloud Sync**: Store progress data in the cloud for cross-device access
2. **Certificates**: Generate downloadable certificates for completion milestones
3. **Social Features**: Share achievements with other educators
4. **Analytics**: Detailed learning analytics and insights
5. **Gamification**: Additional badges, streaks, and rewards
6. **Export Data**: Allow users to export their progress data

## Files Modified

- `src/services/ProgressService.ts` - Core progress tracking service
- `src/views/ProgressPage.vue` - New progress dashboard page
- `src/views/DisabilityPage.vue` - Integration with quiz completion
- `src/views/FolderPage.vue` - Home page progress summary
- `src/router/index.ts` - Added progress page route
- `src/App.vue` - Added progress page to navigation menu

## Browser Compatibility

The progress tracking feature uses modern web APIs:

All features gracefully degrade for older browsers while maintaining core functionality.
